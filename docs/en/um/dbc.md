# CAN DBC

EcuBus-Pro supports parsing most CAN DBC files. If you encounter any DBC files that cannot be parsed correctly, please report the issue on our [Github Issues](https://github.com/ecubus/EcuBus-Pro/issues) page.

The application provides an efficient search interface for messages and signals.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, EcuBus-Pro only supports viewing DBC files and does not support editing. Please ensure your DBC file is correctly formatted before use.
