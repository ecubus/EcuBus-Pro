# Feature Request Process

## Steps

1. Create a feature [issue](https://github.com/ecubus/EcuBus-Pro/issues/new/choose) in the GitHub repository.
2. Clearly describe the feature you want to add, including its purpose and how it will benefit users.
3. Label the issue with `enhancement` to categorize it appropriately.

To ensure we prioritize features that benefit the community, new feature requests need at least 5 GitHub reactions (👍) before being considered for our backlog.

## How to Up-vote
